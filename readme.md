# Simple To-Do Page
We now have all the basic tools of the front end at our disposal. Let's put them to work by creating a To-Do List application.

## Steps:
* Create your HTML/CSS/JS files
* Display a list of items that you need to do. 
* Create a form at the bottom of the list to add more things to your todo list
* Create the ability to check off things from your todo list. When you check an item off, make sure that it has a ~~strikethrough~~ so that you know what you've already done.
* Style it! Look into using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling in addition to vanilla css.

## Bonus:
* Use local storage to store these items, so that the user's data persists after refreshing the page.
